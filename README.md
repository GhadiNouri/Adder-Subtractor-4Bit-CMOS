# Adder/Subtractor 4Bit CMOS

Digital full-adder and full-subtractor are the basic logic circuits which can find applications in digital computing and packet labels processing. The rapid increase in the number of transistors on chips has enabled a dramatic increase in the performance of computing systems, Computation needs to be performed using low-power, area-efficient circuits operating at greater speed. The code has been written using Verilog - Hardware Description Language.
